# 21DayCodingChallenge
[Lighthouse Labs Challenge](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca)

My solutions for various Lighthouse Labs challenges.  


Challenges:
* [Nov 2019](https://github.com/nstha21/21DayCodingChallenge/tree/master/Nov2019)
  * Note: Not all the challenges were solely completed by me! I had to get help from the felp forums quite often as I am not overly familiar with JS! 
    * I peeped a the discussion page and added neat/unique/different solutions as "variations" in the last 3 challenges for future reference as well as code efficiency comparison!
  * The questions are also attached as comments for me (or anyone else!) to go over what the question was and try to do the challenges again.
